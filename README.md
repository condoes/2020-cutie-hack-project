The game is played with a deck of 63 cards - 21 each of rock, paper, and scissors. Each player receives five cards. 
Players then put a card on the table - the "head card". The rules are the same as a normal rock, paper, scissors game. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. In case of a tie, whoever has more cards matching their head card in their hand wins. Whoever wins 3 rounds wins the whole game!
