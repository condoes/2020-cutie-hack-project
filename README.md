The game is played with a deck of 63 cards - 21 each of rock, paper, and scissors. Each player receives five cards and is given one discard round. 
Players then put a card on the table - the "head card". After a betting round, there is the showdown. The rules are the same as a normal rock, paper, 
scissors game. In case of a tie, however, the game is switched to poker mode: whoever has more cards matching their head card wins. There are five rounds,
but during each one players have to pay a mandatory participation fee that is doubled every turn. In turn one, the minimum bet is 10 votes, then in turn 
two 20 votes and so on. The player with the most votes at the end wins, regardless of how many rounds are won
